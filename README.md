# Neighborhood Map
===============================

### Overview
The fifth project for the Udacity FEND program. In this project I have used Google Maps API, Foursquare API, and knockout.js to create a web app that displays 5 best cafes in Riga, Latvia.

To explore the codebase:
- Visit https://github.com/raviilva/neighborhoodmap
- Clone or download the repository
- Double click **index.html** to open the app

### How the App functions

Using the data from Google and Foursquare API, the user may load more information on the five locations by clicking on the marker. You may also use the search bar and filter the other locations already shown on the map. In case of a google maps or foursquare error, the user will be notified.
